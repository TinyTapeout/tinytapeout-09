## How it works

This is a 4-bit adder that takes two 4-bit inputs and adds them, outputting them as a 5-bit number.

## How to test

Flip the DIP Switch with inputs 0-3 corresponding to the first number and 4-7 corresponding to the second number. See if the output leds light up in a way that makes sense if the two numbers were added.

## External hardware

DIP Switch and a 7-segment display or leds.
