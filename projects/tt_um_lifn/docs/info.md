## How it works

The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron is a simple model of neuronal behavior. In this design, the neuron receives an input signal (spike) and integrates this input over time by increasing its internal membrane potential. If there is no input, the membrane potential "leaks" or decays gradually over time, simulating the natural loss of charge in biological neurons.

When the membrane potential reaches a defined threshold, the neuron fires a spike output, after which the membrane potential resets to zero. This process emulates the firing and reset cycle of biological neurons, providing a digital approximation of spiking behavior.
