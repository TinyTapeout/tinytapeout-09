## How it works

Two numbers in [0-15] are converted into 4 bit binary numbers. For example, A = 8 and B = 3:
A = 1000
B = 0011
The two numbers are then added.

## How to test

Enter the numbers using the switches (inputs 0-3 for A (LSB=0), inputs 4-7 for B (LSB=4)) and observe the ouput (LSB=0)

## External hardware

Switches for input (8), LEDs for output (5).
