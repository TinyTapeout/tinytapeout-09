## How it works

It uses 4 invertors, XOR, OR gates with 8 inputs, and 6 outputs, producing 6 out of 8 segments that can be lit up or not. 

## How to test

Switches 1 & 2 turn the top segment on or off depending on if only one switch is on. Switch 3 turns on or off the top right segment, switch 4 turns on or off the bottom right segment, switch 6 turns on or off the bottom left segment, switch 7 turns on or off the bottom segment, switch 8 turns on or off the top left segment.
