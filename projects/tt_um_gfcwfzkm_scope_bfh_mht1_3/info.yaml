  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

  # WARNING: VHDL support in Tiny Tapeout is experimental. The template may get changes during
  #          the shuttle and VHDL support may be dropped for future shuttles if we see low usage.
