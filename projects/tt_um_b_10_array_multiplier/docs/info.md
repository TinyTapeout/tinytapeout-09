## How it works
An array multiplier is a combinational digital circuit used to multiply two binary numbers. It is structured similarly to the multiplication process, where partial products are generated and added to produce the final product. The array multiplier makes use of full adders, arranged in a systematic array to handle the binary addition of partial products. This process is shown in the image 4x4_array_multiplier.png located in the docs folder as well as shown in this preview.

## How to test
To ensure new hardware is working correctly, start with a visual inspection for any physical damage and verify that all components are properly connected. Power up the hardware to confirm it initializes without errors, and check that your system detects it, typically through device manager or similar tools. Run any manufacturer-provided diagnostics or benchmarking tools to verify core functions and performance meet expectations. Test specific functionalities (such as I/O, communication, or display output), and update firmware or drivers if necessary. Conduct stress tests to check for stability under load, and perform any necessary compatibility and environmental checks to ensure the hardware is fully operational in its intended use case.
