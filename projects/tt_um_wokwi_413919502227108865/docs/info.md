## How it works

This works by utilizing only one AND gate and one OR gate.

## How to test

To test, turn on each input except for input 6 and 7, for 6 and 7, only turn one of them on as they uilize an OR gate, meaning  one of them have to be on to recieve an output, to ensure its working correctly, it should output the number 8 with a dot at the end.

## External hardware

None
