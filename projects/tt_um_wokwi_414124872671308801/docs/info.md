## How it works

I have used a 4bit synchronous counter to used And and Or gates to simulate "." and "-" of morsecode.

## How to test

We can test it by connecting a 7 segment display and we can change inputs with a button(for J it's ".---" and for R it's ".-.").

## External hardware

button, 7 segment display, clock
