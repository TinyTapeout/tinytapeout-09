## How it works

This project functions as a demostration device for different gates. IN0 goes through a NOT gate to OUT0. IN1 and IN5 go through an OR gate to OUT1 and OUT5 and they go through a NOR gate to OUT7. IN2, IN3, and IN4 got through a 3-input XOR gate to OUT2 and OUT4. IN6 and IN7 goes through an AND gate to OUT6 and a NAND gate to OUT3.

## How to test

Use the 8 different inputs to test the different gate operations on the board. Connecting the outputs to a seven-segment display or to 8 different LEDs can be used to verify the successful gate operations.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
