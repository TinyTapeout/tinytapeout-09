## How it works

The perceptron takes in three inputs, multiplies them by weights and then sums the products. It then weighs the sum against a threshold to decide whether to outpur 1 or 0. The perceptron also takes in a desired output and performs a weight update when the desired output and actual output don't match. . 

## How to test

Make sure that the clock and reset are working.
