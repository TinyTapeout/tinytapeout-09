## How it works
The project implements an elevator interface on a digital clock based on user floor selection. 
The user selects a floor using the board switches, and the display increments/decrements floor numbers according to the elevator's state (moving up, moving down, or idle). Once the elevator reaches the selected floor, the display shows the user-selected floor number until a different floor is chosen or the switches are reset. When the switches are reset, the display decrements back to the default floor.

## How to test
Use board switches 0-7 to select the desired floor. 

## External hardware
A LED display is used to show elevator operation and the selected floor number.
