## How it works

This project is a simple counter circuit that increments and displays numbers on a 7-segment display. A “Step” button advances the count, and a “Reset” button resets it to zero. Logic gates control the segments based on the counter’s output.

## How to test

Press the “Step” button to increment the display and “Reset” to reset the count. Optionally, connect a clock for automatic counting.
