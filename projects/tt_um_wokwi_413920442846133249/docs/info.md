## How it works

If sel is high, then a counter is output on the output pins and the bidirectional
pins (data_o = counter_o = counter). If sel is low, the bidirectional pins are
mirrored to the output pins (data_o = data_i).

## How to test

Set sel high and observe that the counter is output on the output pins (data_o) and
the bidirectional pins (counter_o). Set sel low and observe that the bidirectional pins are mirrored to the output pins (data_o = data_i)
