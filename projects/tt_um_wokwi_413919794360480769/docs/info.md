## How it works

The metastable multiplier violates the timing delay needed by logic gates to accurately manipulate binary bits the way they're supposed to which causes cases of logic gates outputting a 1 and a 0 at the same time. 

## How to test

First set all inputs to logic 0 and then set all of them to 1.
Observe the metastable of the circuit befure it resolves itself to either a logic 1 or 0.

## External hardware

4 switches are used to control the input along with an external clock and reset
4 Leds are used on the output to display which combination of binary you are using at the input
