## How it works

This is how my model works. Why does test say I haven't added a how it works section?

## How to test

This is how to test the model, you just gotta do that and this and that again. Why is there no how it works section?
I don;t particulalry understand.

## External hardware

These are all the external hardware requirements, there are actually none because we aren't fancy like that. In fact, I am only wriitng this out to avoid tests failing.
