## How it works

This is a basic analog switch.  When the control input is high, the X and Y analog inputs are connected.  When the control input is low, they are not connected.

## How to test

Connect X to digital high.  Connect a pull-down resistor from Y to ground.

Change the value of the control input.  Verify that the inverse of the control input is correct.  Verify that the voltage at Y matches.
