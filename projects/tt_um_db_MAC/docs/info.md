## How it works

The project aims to implement a 8-bit MAC unit for unsigned integer data type using Vedic Multipliers and Reversible gates. The two inputs are to be taken in through input pins and bi-directional pins using half a clock cycle and stored in registers. The MAC operation is performed on the values stored in these registers. The multiplier and adder takes half clock cycle each. The result of the operation is then sent through the output and bidirectional pins.

## How to test

The project will be used to perform mac operations on 8-bit unsigned integers. This is mainly used in systems with fast computation and also primarly explores the concepts of reversible gates for energy efficiency.

## External hardware

No external hardware is used for this project.
