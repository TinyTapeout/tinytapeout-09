# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "Spectrogram extractor, 2 channels"      # Project title
  author:       "Coline Chehense, Dinko Oletic"      # Your name
  discord:      "dinko.oletic"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Digital part of a time-frequency feature extraction sensor interface, two-channel real-time signal amplitude tracker. 7 input lines per channel represent thermometer code output of a flash ADC. Two-channel serial output."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     1000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "6x2"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_Coline3003_spect_top"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
