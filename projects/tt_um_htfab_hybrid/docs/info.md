## How it works

To be added later. In the meanwhile, see the Wikipedia page for [Telephone hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_hybrid).

## How to test

Add a wire between LINE1 and LINE2 (or LINE1 and the line pin of another hybrid).
Voltage signals sent to IN1 should appear on OUT2 while those sent to IN2 should appear on OUT1.

## External hardware

Analog test equipment (e.g. function generator and oscilloscope)
