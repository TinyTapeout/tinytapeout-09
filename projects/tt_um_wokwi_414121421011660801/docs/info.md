## How it works

You use in1 and in0 as binary inputs to display a number in decimal on the 7 segment display. ex. {in0, ~in1}, will display "2". 
## How to test

Use the "1" switch to toggle the most significant bit, and the "2" switch to toggle the least significant bit. 

## External hardware

LED display, 8 input switch.
