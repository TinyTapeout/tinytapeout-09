## How it works
Using inverters to light up an 8 segment clock.
Explain how your project works
My chip uses a variety of 3 different inverters, which also involves a flip-flop inverter. 
## How to test
Flipping the switches will light up its corresponding segment, however the flip flop inverter has its energy stored with switch 3 and 4, which would alternate.
