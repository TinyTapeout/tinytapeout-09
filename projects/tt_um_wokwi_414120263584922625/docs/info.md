## How it works

A simple 8 bit LFSR I took from this paper that popped up in a google search of LFSR designs
[https://nandland.com/lfsr-linear-feedback-shift-register/](https://www.mecs-press.org/ijcnis/ijcnis-v10-n2/IJCNIS-V10-N2-5.pdf)

## How to test

The 8 output pins should output a pseudo random 8 bit number, about once per second

## External hardware

The 8 output pins can be connected to LEDs.
