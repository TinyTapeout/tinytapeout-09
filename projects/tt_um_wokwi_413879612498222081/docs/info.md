## How it works

It allows output displays when the switch is clicked, or clock signal toggles.
This was enabled by using flip-flops.
And it also can be reset using the reset button.

## How to test

Set input toggle switches as you want.
Start test, and check its output changes by clicking the switch button.

## External hardware

Flip-flops are added to enable display at each switch.
