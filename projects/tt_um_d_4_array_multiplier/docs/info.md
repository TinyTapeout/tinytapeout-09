## How it works

This project will receive two four-bit numbers, where both will be multiplied by the 4x4 array multiplier. 
The multiplier executes using combinations of full adders (FAs) and two-input AND gates, linked together as
shown in the attached circuit diagram. Each row represents partial products generated by the AND gates, 
where each bit of one number is ANDed with each bit of the other number. The results are then added column by
column using full adders, with carries propagated to the next stage. The final outputforms the product of the
two four-bit input numbers

## How to test

To test this 4x4 array multiplier, provide an 8-bit number, which then will be split into two 4-bit inputs by the multiplier's
design source. The circuit will calculate the product, displayed on output. It will compare this output to the expected result
to verify the answer. Testing with different 8-bit values will ensure reliable functionality across various inputs.
