## How it works

This project demonstrates trivial AND gates and inverters.
To be used for demonstrating logical inputs/outputs, tool flow, and 3D visualization.


## How to test

OUT0 is driven by the logical AND value from  IN0 and RST_N
OUT1 is driven by the logical AND value from  IN1 and IN0

OUT2 is driven by the opposite (inverted) logic value from IN2 
OUT3 is driven by the opposite (inverted) logic value from IN3

OUT4 is driven by the logic value at IN4 
OUT5 is driven by the logic value at IN5 
OUT6 is driven by the logic value at IN6 
OUT7 is driven by the logic value at IN7 


## External hardware

RESET pushbutton
DIP Switch (for inputs)
LED display
