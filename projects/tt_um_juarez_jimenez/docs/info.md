## How it works

neuromorphic-inspired LFSR with "synaptic neurons" that simulate excitatory / inhibitory responses. Each bit in the LFSR acts like a neuron, where detected edges (transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) generate excitatory or inhibitory signals, similar to synaptic inputs in neural networks. These signals modify the LFSRâ€™s feedback , leading to behavior that mimics how biological synapses manage signal flow by either enhancing or suppressing activity. The result is a random sequence influenced by synaptic-like interactions.
