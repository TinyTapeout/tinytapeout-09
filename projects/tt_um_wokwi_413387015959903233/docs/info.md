## How it works

This is a simple project to test then end-to-end manufacturing process as a first-time tiny tapeout user.

## How to test

The whole project is two gates:
- a NAND gate composed of AND and NOT (pins IN0, IN1, OUT0)
- a NOT gate (pins IN2, OUT1)

## External hardware

No particular external hardware is required, other than a power supply and some test tools (output scope, logic level inputs).
