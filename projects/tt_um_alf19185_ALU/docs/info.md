## How it works

The 4 bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) has 2 inputs of 4 bits for each operand, 1 input of 3 bits to select the operational mode, 1 output of 8 bits with the result of the selected operation and 2 outputs of 1 bit each to identify an overflow or zero.

To test the design, the opcode was configured for addition (000), substraction (001), multiplication (010), division (011) and for zero (100).
