## How it works

It has a 3 bit counter that counts up to 7 and then resets. The counter is displayed on a 7-segment display.

## How to test

To test, connect the 7-segment display to the ASIC and run the program. The counter should be displayed on the display. The counter should reset to 0 after pressing the reset button.

## External hardware

7-segment display, reset button for nreset
