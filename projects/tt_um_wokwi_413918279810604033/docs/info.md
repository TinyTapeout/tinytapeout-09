## How it works


**My project uses a mulitplexor to light up an LED as well as the display module.**
## How to test


**Check if the LED and display both light up by switching input 7 on/off and inputs 4 and 6, if in7 is on then in 6 should turn the lights on. If in 7 is off then in4 will turn on the lights**
## External hardware
**LED display & LED diode**
