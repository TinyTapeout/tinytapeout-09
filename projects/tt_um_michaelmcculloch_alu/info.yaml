  author:       "Michael McCulloch"      # Your name
  discord:      "haosgreulur"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Should work as a 2 6 bit input ALU, which then can choose from the RISCV ALU opcodes to select the operation which will be outputed in 8bit"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
