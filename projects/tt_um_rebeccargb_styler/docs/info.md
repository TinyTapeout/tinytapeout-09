## How it works

The styler chip is used to transform a 16x16 character glyph bitmap based on a
set of text mode attributes. It consists of a 4-bit scanline register, an 8-bit
control register, a 16-bit bitmap register, and a 25-bit attribute register.
Additionally, three independent input lines are used to control polarity of
faint text (even or odd pixels), text and cursor blink rate, and cursor position.

Typical use of the styler chip follows these steps:

1. Set output enable (input 6) HIGH and write enable (input 7) LOW.
2. Set the address (inputs 0-2) to 0.
3. Set the bidirectional pins to the physical scanline number.
4. Pulse `clk`.
5. Set output enable (input 6) LOW and write enable (input 7) HIGH.
6. Read the logical scanline number from the bidirectional pins.
7. Set output enable (input 6) HIGH and write enable (input 7) LOW.
8. Set the address (inputs 0-2) to 2.
9. Set the bidirectional pins to the right half of the row of the character bitmap corresponding to the logical scanline number.
10. Pulse `clk`.
11. Set the address (inputs 0-2) to 3.
12. Set the bidirectional pins to the left half of the row of the character bitmap corresponding to the logical scanline number.
13. Pulse `clk`.
14. Set output enable (input 6) LOW and write enable (input 7) HIGH.
15. Set the address (inputs 0-2) to 2.
16. Read the right half of the final character bitmap from the bidirectional pins.
17. Set the address (inputs 0-2) to 3.
18. Read the left half of the final character bitmap from the bidirectional pins.

You can also read from the dedicated output pins without changing output enable or write enable.

The register layout is as follows:
