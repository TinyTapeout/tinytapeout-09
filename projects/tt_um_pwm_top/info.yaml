# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "Generador PWM multiproposito con frecuencia y ciclo de trabajo modulable"      # Project title
  author:       "Marco Vázquez, Paúl González, Abimael Jimenez, UACJ"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "A PWM generator with a 6-bit input that allows the user to enter a denominator that divides the frequency. Using a pair of control inputs, we can increase or decrease the duty cycle of the modulated output by 10%." # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     5000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_pwm_top"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
