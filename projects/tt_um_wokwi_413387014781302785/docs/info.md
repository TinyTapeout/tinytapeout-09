## How it works

Enter the right combination of bits to display an "L" on the seven segment display.  The combination is 0b00101111.  Once that combination is entered
you'll need to press the "Step" button in order to display the L on the display.  Releasing the Step button will clear the display.

## How to test

Try different combinations of inputs.  The only time the output should be displayed is when the right bit combination is entered and the Step button is pressed.

## External hardware

Requires a 7 segment display, a push button connected to power, and a 8 bit wide DIP switch.
