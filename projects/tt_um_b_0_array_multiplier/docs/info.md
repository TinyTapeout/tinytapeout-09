## How it works


There will be two 4-bit inputs that represents the binary factors and an 8-bit output for the product. With the use of Full Adders, it combines the partial products and produces the final binary multiplication result. 


## How to test


To test this project, there are two inputs. You would set one of them to a negative in 2's complement form, in binary. You would then multiply both these inputs in binary and should have a signed integer that accurately represents the multiplication.
