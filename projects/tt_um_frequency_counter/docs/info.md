## How it works

Project measures frequency on ui[0] input by counting pulses during 100ms periods. Measured frequency is then displayed on graphical 128x32 pixels OLED display in form of emulated 7-segment display.

## How to test

Internal logic needs 1MHz clock (to be generated by RPi Pico)
* Connect PMOD OLED display to see measurement
* Connect unknown frequency signal to be measured to ui[0]

## External hardware

Freqquency is displayed on 128x32 OLED display with SSD1306 controller: [PMOD OLED](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodoled/start?srsltid=AfmBOorLYfaDc8BpQC9A5OXZzMUAsCeca8Y7uBRi8CIp-gxW1e7fsLZP)
