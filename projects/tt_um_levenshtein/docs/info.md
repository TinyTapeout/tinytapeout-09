## How it works

tt09-levenshtein is a fuzzy search engine which can find the best matching word in a dictionary based on levenshtein distance.

Fundamentally its an implementation of the bit-vector levenshtein algorithm from Heikki Hyyr√∂'s 2022 paper with the title *A Bit-Vector Algorithm for Computing Levenshtein and Damerau Edit Distances*.

### SPI

The device is organized as a wishbone bus which is accessed through commands on an SPI bus.

The maximum SPI frequency is 25% of the master clock.

**Input bytes:**

| Byte | Bit | Description                               |
|------|-----|-------------------------------------------|
| 0    | 7   | READ=`0` WRITE=`1`                        |
| 0    | 6-0 | Address bit 22-16                         |
| 1    | 7-0 | Address bit 15-8                          |
| 2    | 7-0 | Address bit 7-0                           |
| 3    | 7-0 | Byte to write if WRITE, otherwise ignored |

**Output bytes:**

| Byte | Bit | Description                              |
|------|-----|------------------------------------------|
| 0    | 7-0 | Byte read if READ, otherwise just `0x00` |

Since the SPI bridges to a wishbone bus which is shared by another master and because register and SRAM have different latencies, the response time is variable.

While the bus is working, the output bits will be zero. The final output byte will be preceeded by a one-bit.

Note that this means that the value `0x5A` can appear 8 different ways on the SPI bus:

```
01 5A   0000000 1 01011010
02 B4   000000 1 01011010 0
05 68   00000 1 01011010 00
0A D0   0000 1 01011010 000
15 A0   000 1 01011010 0000
2B 40   00 1 01011010 00000
56 80   0 1 01011010 000000
AD 00   1 01011010 00000000
```


### Memory Layout

As indicated by the SPI protocol, the address space is 23 bits.

The address space is basically as follows:

| Address  | Size | Access | Identifier  |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| 0x000000 | 1    | R/W    | `CTRL`      |
| 0x000001 | 1    | R/O    | `DISTANCE`  |
| 0x000002 | 2    | R/O    | `INDEX`     |
| 0x000200 | 512  | R/W    | `VECTORMAP` |
| 0x000400 | 8M   | R/W    | `DICT`      |

**CTRL**

The control register is used to start the engine and see when it has completed.

The layout is as follows:

| Bits | Size | Access | Description                                                 |
|------|------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-4  | 4    | R/W    | Word length                                                 |
| 5-6  | 2    | R/O    | Not used                                                    |
| 7    | 1    | R/O    | Is set to `1` while the engine runs and `0` when it is done |

When data is written to this address, the engine automatically starts.

**DISTANCE**

When the engine has finished executing, this address contains the levenshtein distance of the best match.

**INDEX**

When the engine has finished executing, this address contains the index of the best word from the dictionary.

**VECTORMAP**

The vector map must contain the corresponding bitvector for each input byte in the alphabet.

If the search word is `application`, the bit vectors will look as follows:

| Letter | Index  | Bit vector                              |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `a`    | `0x61` | `16'b00000000_01000001` (`a_____a____`) |
| `p`    | `0x70` | `16'b00000000_00000110` (`_pp________`) |
| `l`    | `0x6C` | `16'b00000000_00001000` (`___l_______`) |
| `i`    | `0x69` | `16'b00000001_00010000` (`____i___i__`) |
| `c`    | `0x63` | `16'b00000000_00100000` (`_____c_____`) |
| `t`    | `0x74` | `16'b00000000_10000000` (`_______t___`) |
| `o`    | `0x6F` | `16'b00000010_00000000` (`_________o_`) |
| `n`    | `0x6E` | `16'b00000100_00000000` (`__________n`) |
| *      | *      | `16'b00000000_00000000` (`___________`) |

Since each vector is 16-bit, the corresponding address is `0x200 + index * 2`

**DICT**

The word list.

The word list is stored of a sequence of words, each encoded as a sequence of 8-bit characters and terminated by the byte value `0x00`. The list itself is terminated with the byte value `0x01`.

Note that the algorithm doesn't care about the particular characters. It only cares if they are identical or not, so even though the algorithm doesn't support UTF-8 and is limited to a character set of 254 characters,
ignoring Asian alphabets, a list of words usually don't contain more than 254 distinct characters, so you can practially just map lettters to a value between 2 and 255.

## How to test

You can compile the client as follows:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cmake -G Ninja -B build .
cmake --build build
```

Next, you can run the test tool:

```sh
./build/client/client --device tt09 --test
```

This will load 1024 words of random length and characters into the SRAM and then perform a bunch of searches, verifying that the returned result is correct.

## External hardware

To operate, the device needs an SPI PSRAM PMOD. The design is tested with the QQSPI PSRAM PMOD from Machdyne, but any memory PMOD will work as long as it supports:

* WRITE (`0x02`) with no latency
* READ (`0x03`) with no latency
* 24-bit addresses
* Uses pin 0 for `SS#`.

Note, that this makes the SRAM/Flash PMOD from mole99 incompatible, but the spi-ram-emu project for the RP2040 can be used if it is changed to 24-bit adressing (It can just ignore the eight most significant bits)
