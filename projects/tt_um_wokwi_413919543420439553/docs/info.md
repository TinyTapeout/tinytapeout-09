## How it works

my project shows the similarities and differences between nand and and, and also or and xor

## How to test

in0 and in1 are connected to the or(out1) and xor(out0). in2 and in3 are connected to and(out3) and nand(out2)

## External hardware

This project uses a 7 seg display, but any indicator will work
