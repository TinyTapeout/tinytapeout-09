## How it works

Control block for a basic 8-bit CPU design building off the SAP-1.

Implemented using a 6 stage sequential counter for sequencing micro-instructions, and a LUT for corresponding op-code to operation(s).

The 8-bit ripple carry adder assumes 2s complement inputs and thus supports addition and subtraction. It pushes the result to the bus via tri-state buffer. It also includes a zero flag to support conditional operation as well as a carry flag. These flags are synchronized to the rising edge of the clock and are updated when the adder outputs to the bus. 

The accumulator register functions to store the output of the adder. It is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock. The accumulator loads and outputs its value from the bus and is connected via tri-state buffer. The accumulatorâ€™s current value is always available as an ouput (and usually connected to the Register A input of the ALU)

## How to test

Provide input of op-code. Check that the correct output bits are being asserted/deasserted properly.
