## How it works

My Wokwi design is a simple full adder schematic. There are three inputs that correspond to two 1-bit inputs and a carry bit. There are two outputs hooked up to two LEDs (one red and one blue) that correspond to the sum and carry bits respectively.

## How to test

:/

## External hardware

External hardware for this project includes two LEDs (colors are up to discretion)
