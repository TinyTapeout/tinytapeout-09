  title: "Two LIF Neurons with STDP Learning"
  author: "Sebastian Hernandez"

  description: "A compact spiking neural network implementation featuring:
    - Two Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons connected via plastic synapse
    - Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for dynamic weight adjustment
    - 8-bit fixed-point arithmetic for state and weight representation
    - Real-time monitoring of spikes and synaptic weight"
