In this puzzle you have to work out how to set the switches to get the last led to light up.

Your friend has been working hard to plan a vacation. (Un)fortunately, they love digital logic, so rather than print you an itinerary, they drew you the following digital circuit.

## How to test
  
Two vacations are possible: can you use the switches to figure out where you'll go, what you'll eat, and what souvenir you'll return with?
