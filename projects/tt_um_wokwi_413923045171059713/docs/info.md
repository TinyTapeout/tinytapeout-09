## How it works

The project uses Logic Gates (AND, NAND, OR, XOR, NOT) to Control the Output of a 7-Segment Display

## How to test

The project uses a Switch containing 8 electrical switches that control the input depending on which switch is on or off. Then the input will go to the logic gate which will result in an output that will be displayed on the 7-segment display

## External hardware

Switch, Buttons
