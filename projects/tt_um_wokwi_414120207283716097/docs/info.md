## How it works

This implements a full adder on IN0, IN1, and IN2 switches (for A, B, and Carry). It uses 2 XOR gates, 2 AND gates, and an OR gate.

## How to test

Output will be LEDs on OUT0 and OUT1. The output will be the binary sum of IN0+IN1+IN2.

## External hardware

LEDs are used on OUT0 and OUT1.
