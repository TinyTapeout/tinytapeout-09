## How it works

A Pseudo-Differential Time to Digital Converter (TDC)

## How to test

The TDC has two analog inputs start and stop and one digital output vector. Provide two square signals to the start and stop inputs with different phases. Read the measured phase difference from the digital output vector.

## External hardware

Signal generator with two outputs to generate the start and stop signals, and a logic analyzer to read the digital output.
