## How it works
takes in two inputs a and b, along with carry_in and gives output across 2 pins, sum and carry_out

## How to test
to ensure correct working of the full adder , toggle with the inputs , if any two inputs are high , the sum should be LOW and the carry_out should be HIGH , if any one input is HIGH the sum should be HIGH and the carry_out should be LOW and if all three inputs are HIGH both sum and carry_out should be HIGH.


## External hardware
LED display.
