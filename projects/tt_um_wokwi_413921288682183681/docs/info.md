## How it works

This tile design is rather simple - an 8:3 oncoder with the ability to invert the output if desired

## How to test

Provide 8 signals, and then watch the 3 outputs

## External hardware

On your signal outputs, hook up leds. This will give a visual indicator of the signals changing.
