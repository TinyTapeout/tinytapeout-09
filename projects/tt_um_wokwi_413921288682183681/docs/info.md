## How it works

This chip design is rather simple - it takes four inputs and a clock signal to drive four signal paths at the speed of the clock. 

## How to test

Hook up a clock signal and four inputs, then power and test. 

## External hardware

On your four signal outputs, hook up either a 7 segment display or leds. This will give a visual indicator of the signals changing at the speed of the clock.
