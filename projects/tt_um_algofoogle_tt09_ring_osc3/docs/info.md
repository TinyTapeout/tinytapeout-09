## What is this?

See [tt09-ring-osc](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt09-ring-osc) and [tt09-ring-osc2](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt09-ring-osc2) for my other ring oscillator experiments on TT09.

This one has a configurable ring oscillator; the feedback can be tapped at different parts of the chain.

This use verilog to instantiate the rings of (an odd number of) `sky130_fd_sc_hd__inv_2` cells.
